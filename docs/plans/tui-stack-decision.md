# TUI Stack Decision

**Status:** Accepted and implemented. The automatable spike and production
interaction gates are represented in repository tests/benchmarks; true desktop
IME and credentialed provider/terminal runs remain external release evidence.
**Date:** 2026-07-09.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-07-15.
**Scope:** Why the production `apps/carina-tui` uses Go and Bubble Tea v2, which
interaction contracts were adopted, and where automated evidence ends.
**Inputs:** `docs/plans/agent-cli-productization.md` (§P1, §P3, §4 microcopy, §6 brand questions), `docs/brand/brand-brief.md` (§2 palette/ANSI token table), a mid-2026 landscape survey of Rust TUI frameworks, an Ink/Claude-Code internals analysis, and a Carina integration audit (RPC contract, Go vs Rust client paths, layer-model boundaries).

**Provenance note:** landscape claims below (stars, release dates, issue numbers) come from a survey conducted against primary sources (repos, release pages, issue trackers) as of June–July 2026 and are reproduced here with their evidence markers. Claims are tagged **[verified]** (primary source seen in the survey) or **[claimed/unverified]** (inference or absence-of-evidence). Nothing in this document was answered from memory where the survey said evidence was missing — those gaps are listed as unknowns in §2.4 and become spike pass/fail criteria in §4.

## 0. Decision in one paragraph

**The TUI is built in Go on Bubble Tea v2 + lipgloss + bubbles (Charm stack), as `apps/carina-tui` in the existing Go module.** Runner-up: **Rust ratatui**, adopted only if the Go spike fails its zh-input or transcript-latency gates (§3.3). The user's starting hypothesis — the React model, ideally in Rust — does not survive the matrix: the only genuinely React-model Rust framework that is alive (iocraft) has open CJK text-input bugs and bus factor 1, which disqualifies it against Carina's zh-first-class requirement; and the requirements decomposition (§1.3) shows that what "React" actually buys is a rendering-pipeline checklist that Bubble Tea v2's new cell-diffing renderer satisfies natively, without a VDOM. Meanwhile the integration audit is lopsided: a Go TUI reuses `go/rpc`, the typed domain structs, socket discovery, and the P1.5/P3.1 shared data layer for free (~zero plumbing LoC); a Rust TUI must build the repo's first Rust JSON-RPC *client*, hand-maintain wire types in a second language forever, and either forfeit or forcibly relocate the plan-mandated shared renderer engine.

## 1. Requirements

### 1.1 Functional (from P1/P3)

| ID | Requirement | Source |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R1 | **Approval prompt whose body is a reviewable artifact**: colored unified diff for patch decisions, canonicalized command for exec, plan text for mode changes; 2–4 structured options (once/session/project/deny-with-reason); resolves `decision_id` over existing RPC (`task.approval.resolve` / `task.action.approve`) | P1.1 |
| R2 | **Streaming session transcript** with collapse/expand; entries with kernel verdict `read-only-allow` collapse by default (governance as visual hierarchy) | P3.1 |
| R3 | **Terminal history escape hatches**: a full-screen viewport for focused operation, an explicit normal-buffer mode for native terminal history, and a plain transcript pager. A strict commit-once static/dynamic renderer is reconsidered only if measured product evidence shows these modes are insufficient | Ink-lessons checklist (b)(f); resolution in §5.3 |
| R4 | **Task progress pills** rendered from **server-side computed** pill segments (`/status` RPC) — client renders truth, doesn't compute it | P3.2 |
| R5 | **Audit views**: audit browser, pager for long replays | P3.1, P3.5 |
| R6 | **Degrade statuses end-to-end**: four-glyph vocabulary (`✓ ⚿ ✗ ~`) with ASCII/NO_COLOR fallbacks; distinct microcopy per initiator | P1.3 |
| R7 | **Degrade to plain CLI / `--json` parity**: TUI is a skin over the same daemon RPC data layer as the CLI renderer — "one engine, two skins" | P1.5, P3.1 (hard architectural mandate) |
| R8 | **Reconnect state machine**: exponential backoff, permanent-failure classification for policy denials, >60s gap resets retry budget | P3.3 |
| R9 | **First-paint discipline**: input frame paints first; index warmup/git status/audit-head verify load in background; stdin buffered from process start and replayed | P3.1 |
| R10 | **Notifications**: terminal bell + OSC 9/777 when a background session blocks on approval | P3.5 |

### 1.2 zh as a first-class locale

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R11 | All width math via grapheme clustering + east-asian-width (CJK = 2 columns) — layout, wrapping, and **cursor column computation in text inputs** |
| R12 | Committed multi-byte input inserts/deletes/backspaces by grapheme, not byte or rune |
| R13 | Physical cursor kept exactly at the logical caret cell, so the terminal places the IME candidate window correctly (this is the industry failure mode: bubbletea #874, Claude Code #19207/#22732) |
| R14 | Bracketed paste with paste-vs-typing detection and `[Pasted X lines]` collapse |
| R15 | Accept as industry reality: in-TUI composition preview is unsolved everywhere (Ink, Claude Code, Bubble Tea all fail it). Mitigation is R13, not a framework feature. Test matrix: macOS Pinyin, fcitx5/Wayland, Windows Terminal + MS Pinyin |

### 1.3 The React model, decomposed (what the user actually needs)

From the Claude Code Ink-internals analysis: "React" is one implementation of five properties, and Claude Code had to *fork Ink* and add compiler memoization + context splitting to keep them. The transferable requirements are:

| ID | Requirement | Note |
|----|-------------|------|
| R16 | UI = f(state): declarative frame description, no manual escape-sequence bookkeeping | Satisfiable in Elm, immediate-mode, or retained styles |
| R17 | Minimal steady-state output: double-buffered screen with cell/row-level delta, never full repaint; correctness escape hatches (resize, SIGCONT, occlusion → force full repaint) | Bubble Tea v2 "Cursed Renderer" does this at framework layer **[verified: v2 release]**; Ink needed Claude Code's in-tree rewrite to do it well |
| R18 | Per-line/segment render caching so a huge transcript costs O(changed rows) | Ink charCache lesson; manual in Go (string builders cached per entry), manual in ratatui too |
| R19 | Component-scoped, independently testable units; update-frequency isolation (a spinner tick must not re-render the tree) | Elm gives this via sub-model discipline, not for free |
| R20 | Priority-aware input: keystroke echo preempts expensive derived work | Event-loop architecture question, not framework feature |
| R21 | Single-cursor arbitration ("declared cursor"): topmost active input owns the physical cursor; approval dialog overlaying the prompt steals it | Directly serves R13 |
| R22 | Repaint attribution/observability from day one (which region caused the full repaint?) | Claude Code's `CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG_REPAINTS` lesson |

**Anti-requirements** (where React *hurt* Claude Code): cascading re-renders needing compiler memoization; VDOM + Yoga + WASM as a heavy dependency chain for a character grid; blit-correctness dirty-pixel bugs. The industry convergence in 2025–26 (Bubble Tea v2 Cursed Renderer, opencode's Zig-core OpenTUI) is *cell-diff renderer + declarative view, without React itself*.

### 1.4 Hard constraints

| ID | Constraint |
|----|-----------|
| C1 | **No Node.js at runtime** — CI has a dedicated `no-node-runtime` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:60`). Disqualifies Ink and OpenTUI (Bun/TS runtime) outright. |
| C2 | **P3.1 shared data layer**: every TUI view is a component over a daemon RPC *shared with the Go CLI renderer* (extends P1.5). A different-language TUI either duplicates or relocates this layer. |
| C3 | **Theming from the brand token table**: `docs/brand/brand-brief.md` §2 — truecolor hex + 256-color fallbacks + mono; semantic ANSI mapping (error→Crimson/132, warning→Star Gold/137, success→Core Glow/139, info→Blue Giant/189, muted→Dust Mauve/96). One palette table, NO_COLOR honored (P3.5). |
| C4 | **Microcopy engine consumption**: Governed/Degrade registers from `go/microcopy` (P1.7) — a Go package. A non-Go TUI must re-implement the FNV-1a seeded deterministic pick + suppression rules or call through RPC. |
| C5 | Distribution through the existing tarball/homebrew pipeline (`scripts/package-release.sh` already stages `bin/carina-tui`). |

## 2. Candidates and evaluation matrix

### 2.1 Candidate profiles (evidence summary, mid-2026)

- **Bubble Tea v2 + lipgloss + bubbles (Go).** Elm architecture (Model/Update/View), *not* React. v2.0.0 released 2026-02-23 — first breaking release in six years — with a declarative `tea.View` struct and the "Cursed Renderer" (ncurses-style cell-level diffing), i.e. the framework independently converged on Ink's double-buffer + minimal-delta pipeline **[verified]**. v2.0.8 on 2026-07-03; active monthly cadence; maintained by Charm Inc. (VC-funded, multiple paid maintainers) **[verified]**. CJK width: solid via x/ansi + rivo/uniseg grapheme clustering; bubbles v2 textinput/textarea are wide-char-aware **[verified per survey]**. IME: issue #874 (candidate window misplaced, Linux/fcitx5) open since Nov 2023, milestoned to v2.0.0, **still open** at survey time **[verified]** — the exact R13 risk. No flexbox; layout is lipgloss joins + manual width math. Flagship precedent: **charmbracelet/crush**, a full agentic coding TUI (streaming transcripts, tool-approval dialogs, diff rendering, session switching) built by the framework's own maintainers — the closest existing analogue to Carina's TUI **[verified]**. Counter-signal: SST's opencode v1.0 *left* Bubble Tea for a TS+Zig stack explicitly to get a React/Solid component model **[verified]**.
- **ratatui (+ ecosystem) (Rust).** Immediate-mode; you own the event loop. The anchor of the Rust TUI world: 21.5k stars, ~36M downloads, 4600+ dependent crates, org-maintained (multiple maintainers — best maintenance story surveyed); v0.30.1 stable June 5, 2026 **[verified]**. **Strongest CJK evidence of any candidate**: unicode-width handling is an actively managed maintainer concern (deliberate 0.2.0 pin after the width-table controversy, discussion #1438); `Frame::set_cursor_position` gives the correct terminal-IME architecture for R13; and the killer field datum — **OpenAI Codex CLI, a governed-agent TUI with approval prompts and streaming transcripts, ships on ratatui and received CJK word-navigation fixes in production (openai/codex PR #16829)** — while Ink-based Claude Code has the open IME bug **[verified]**. Richest widget ecosystem: ratatui-textarea (unicode-aware editor), ansi-to-tui (render `delta`/git colored diffs directly), syntect-tui, ratkit (code-diff widget), viewports, gauges. Not the React model — TEA-style state struct or a hand-rolled signal layer.
- **iocraft (Rust).** The genuine React model in Rust: `element!` macro, `#[component]`, hooks, flexbox via taffy; explicitly Ink-inspired. ~1.4k stars, v0.8.3 May 2026, responsive triage — but **single maintainer (bus factor 1)** and 0.x API churn **[verified]**. **Disqualifying for zh today**: open issue #208 (June 19, 2026) — cursor position/indexing errors in TextInput with mixed non-English/English text — is precisely the wide-char cursor math R11 needs, currently broken **[verified]**. No documented east-asian-width strategy, no IME cursor handling, no diff/scrollback/textarea widgets, no ratatui interop. Shipped products (moonrepo proto/moon) are styled console output, not interactive fullscreen TUIs **[verified]**.
- **rooibos (Rust).** Leptos-style signals over ratatui — conceptually ideal (React DX + ratatui widgets) but **pre-alpha by its own README, ~5 stars, single author** **[verified]**. Not adoptable; useful only as a design reference for an in-house signal layer.
- **tui-realm (Rust).** Elm/React hybrid over ratatui; alive (4.1.0 May 2026, tracks ratatui 0.30) but single-maintainer, message-plumbing-heavy, and the model is Elm anyway — it adds a dependency without adding the React model. No CJK evidence either way **[absence of evidence, not correctness]**.
- **dioxus-tui / rink (Rust).** Effectively abandoned: last publish ~2024, removed from Dioxus main branch as of v0.5, frozen on unmaintained tui-rs **[verified]**. Do not adopt.
- **Ink (TypeScript)** and **OpenTUI (Zig core + TS/React bindings, Bun runtime).** Both hard-disqualified by C1. Ink's role in this document is as a *requirements source* (§1.3): the decisive datapoint is that Anthropic could not ship Claude Code on stock Ink — it vendors and deeply forks it (custom reconciler, double-buffer, charCache, virtual scroll, declared cursor) **[verified per internals analysis]**. OpenTUI confirms the survey question "anything newer that is React-for-terminal?": yes, but it's TS-over-native — no new mature Rust React-model entrant appeared in 2025–26.

### 2.2 Integration cost (from the repo audit — all [verified] against source)

The wire protocol is deliberately language-neutral: NDJSON JSON-RPC 2.0 over `~/.carina/daemon.sock`, machine-readable contract in `protocol/jsonrpc/methods.json` + `protocol/schemas/*.json`, approval flow fully wire-visible (`permission.request` events carrying `decision_id`; `go/daemon/approval.go:57-69`). A Rust client *can* drive everything today. But the costs diverge:

| | Go path | Rust path |
|---|---|---|
| RPC client | `go/rpc.Client` exists (149 LoC, used by CLI/SDK/stub) | Build the repo's **first Rust JSON-RPC client** (~300–500 LoC: unix dial, correlation, interleaved-notification demux, second streaming connection) |
| Typed wire models | Same Go module — struct tags already match the wire; zero re-derivation | Hand-write ~500–1000 LoC of structs for Session/Event/PermissionDecision/Task/PatchTransaction; no codegen exists; **permanent drift surface** against Go structs |
| P1.5/P3.1 shared engine (C2) | Shared by construction | Duplicate (~1–2k LoC, two-language drift) or migrate the CLI renderer to Rust too |
| Microcopy engine (C4) | Import `go/microcopy` | Re-implement or RPC round-trip |
| Build/packaging | Already done (Makefile `go:` target, `package-release.sh:153` stages `bin/carina-tui`) | New workspace member + release build + copy line (precedent exists via carina-kernel-service; ~small) |
| Pre-first-view plumbing | **≈ 0 LoC** | **≈ 1.5–3k LoC** |
| Layer-model fit | Control plane + surface = Go (documented) | Surface is marked "TypeScript (initially)" — provisional, so a Rust surface is a doc amendment, not a contract breach; but Rust's documented job is the kernel. Would be the first Rust-as-client of the daemon. |
| SDK state | sdk/go wraps `go/rpc` today | No Rust SDK exists; a Rust TUI creates the fourth SDK-grade client and immediately needs Phase-1 features (streams, approvals) no SDK has reached |

### 2.3 Matrix

### 2.4 Honest unknowns (become spike gates)

1. **Bubble Tea R13**: does #874's failure mode (IME candidate window misplaced) bite on macOS Pinyin and fcitx5 for Carina's inline prompt, and can cursor-position reporting be emitted from the v2 renderer without upstream changes? *Unverified — no one in the survey tested Carina's exact shape.*
2. **Bubble Tea transcript scale**: v2's Cursed Renderer diffs cells, but Go-side `View()` string building for a multi-thousand-line transcript needs manual per-entry caching (the Ink charCache lesson). Achievable, but latency under streaming load is unmeasured.
3. **ratatui zh input**: ratatui-textarea's CJK cursor math is well-evidenced for rendering; Carina-shaped IME behavior on the three-platform matrix is still assumed from Codex CLI's precedent, not tested here.
4. **tui-realm / rooibos CJK input**: no evidence either way; not pursued because both fail other gates.
5. Web access was not re-exercised for this document; all external claims carry the survey's as-of dates (June–July 2026). If any load-bearing claim (esp. #874 status, iocraft #208 status) must be current at spike time, re-check the trackers first.

---

## 3. Recommendation

### 3.1 Primary: Bubble Tea v2 + lipgloss + bubbles (Go)

The matrix is decisive on three gating rows: C2 (P3.1's shared-data-layer mandate is only free in Go), team-stack coherence (the daemon, RPC types, microcopy engine, CLI renderer are all Go), and plumbing cost (≈0 vs 1.5–3k LoC plus permanent two-language wire-type drift). On the requirement the user cares most about — web-grade interaction feel — the decomposition in §1.3 shows the load-bearing parts are the rendering pipeline (R17–R18) and component isolation (R19), and Bubble Tea v2's Cursed Renderer ships R17 at the framework layer, something stock Ink never had (Claude Code built it in-tree). The Elm model is a real tax (message routing, no hooks), but Crush proves Claude-Code-grade agentic UX — streaming transcripts, approval dialogs, diff views — is shippable on exactly this stack by a team smaller than the problem.

**Mitigations for the known weaknesses:**
- *Elm plumbing tax*: adopt a strict component convention from day one — each view is a sub-model with `Init/Update/View` and its own message namespace, mirroring bubbles' convention; P3.2's server-side pill computation and P1.5's shared data layer already push logic out of the client, shrinking what Elm has to route.
- *No flexbox*: Carina's P1/P3 views are lists, panes, and dialogs — lipgloss joins + width math suffice; Claude Code-style absolute overlays exist in v2 layers (young — exercise in spike).
- *Diff widget*: port Crush's chroma + unified/side-by-side diff renderer pattern (in-repo, copyable prior art) and feed it P1.1's reviewable-artifact payloads.
- *R13 IME*: the spike's zh gate (§4.1) decides; the mitigation architecture (single declared cursor, R21, physical cursor pinned to caret) is framework-independent.
- *R18 caching*: per-transcript-entry rendered-string cache keyed on entry revision — the charCache lesson, implemented as a Go map; measure in spike.

### 3.2 Runner-up: ratatui (Rust)

If Go fails its gates, ratatui — not iocraft — is the Rust choice: best maintenance story in the survey, strongest CJK evidence (Codex CLI in production is the closest existing product to Carina's TUI requirements), correct IME cursor architecture, and every P1/P3 widget need (colored diff via ansi-to-tui, textarea, viewport, gauges) exists as a maintained crate. The costs are accepted, not wished away: the first Rust RPC client, hand-written wire types with drift risk, and a P3.1 amendment (either the shared engine is duplicated, or the CLI renderer migrates to Rust too — the honest version of "Rust TUI" is "Rust surface layer", a docs/architecture.md amendment the "TypeScript (initially)" wording permits).

**iocraft is explicitly rejected for now** despite being the truest React-in-Rust: open CJK TextInput cursor bugs (#208, June 2026) fail R11 outright, bus factor 1, no diff/scrollback widgets, no ratatui interop. Reversal condition in §3.3. rooibos is pre-alpha (design reference only); tui-realm adds Elm-with-extra-steps; dioxus-tui is dead.

### 3.3 Reversal triggers

Choose Bubble Tea v2 **unless**:
1. **zh gate fails**: the Go spike cannot get the IME candidate window anchored at the caret (macOS Pinyin + fcitx5) with committed-text grapheme correctness, *and* the ratatui spike passes the same test — then adopt ratatui and schedule the P1.5 engine question as a follow-up decision.
2. **Latency gate fails**: streaming a real session transcript (≥2k lines, 30 events/sec) exceeds p95 16ms redraw or >2% idle CPU after caching mitigations — and ratatui's spike meets it.
3. **Upstream regression**: Charm abandons v2 cadence or #874 is closed as won't-fix with no cursor-reporting workaround (re-check tracker at spike time).

Revisit **iocraft** (not adopt) only if all of: #208/#206-class CJK input bugs are fixed upstream, a second maintainer lands, and a diff/scrollback story exists — reassess at the next TUI milestone, not before.

### 3.4 Hybrid honestly considered — and rejected

- *Go CLI stays + Rust TUI*: pays the full Rust plumbing cost **and** breaks C2 (two data layers, or a Rust engine the Go CLI can't share). Worst of both. Rejected.
- *Everything-Rust surface* (CLI renderer migrates too): coherent but is a re-platforming project stapled to a TUI project; the CLI (P1.x) ships first and is already Go. Only sensible as a deliberate later migration if trigger 1/2 fires.
- *Go TUI + Rust compute over RPC*: already the architecture — the kernel (policy, audit, index) is Rust behind the daemon. The TUI is a thin skin by mandate (R4, R7); there is no TUI-side compute that wants Rust.
- *OpenTUI-style TS-over-native*: C1 kills it regardless of merit.

---

## 4. Spike protocol (completed 2026-07-09)

Both spikes implemented the **same script** against the **real daemon** (no
mocks): connect to `~/.carina/daemon.sock` on two connections (calls + event
stream, per `go/rpc/client.go`'s demux pattern), `session.attach` plus
`session.events.stream`, render a live streaming transcript, and resolve a
reviewable approval over the existing decision RPCs. The tables below preserve
the protocol used to make the decision; the as-run evidence is recorded after
the Appendix.

### 4.1 Common pass/fail gates

| # | Gate | Pass criterion |
|---|------|----------------|
| G1 | Live approval prompt | `permission.request` → prompt with 4 options + colored diff body (use a real `patch-transaction` payload); approve/deny round-trips `decision_id`; Escape always closes (never locks cursor) |
| G2 | Streaming transcript | 2,000-line transcript, 30 events/sec injected: collapse/expand a read-only-allow entry works mid-stream and no visible tearing occurs. Terminal-buffer strategy is resolved separately under R3 rather than silently counted as a renderer pass |
| G3 | zh input — width | Type `carina 审批测试 with mixed 中英 text` into the input: cursor lands on correct cells throughout; backspace deletes by grapheme; paste of 10 CJK lines triggers bracketed-paste collapse |
| G4 | zh input — IME | macOS Pinyin **and** fcitx5 (Linux VM): candidate window appears at the caret cell, not at 0,0 or a stale position; committed text inserts correctly. (In-composition echo inside the TUI is *not* required — R15.) |
| G5 | Idle CPU | < 1% of one core with a spinner + pill visible, measured over 60s (`ps`/`top` sampling) |
| G6 | Redraw latency | p95 keystroke-echo < 16ms and p95 event-to-paint < 33ms under G2 load (instrument with timestamps in the render loop — R22 observability starts here) |
| G7 | Degrade | `--json`-mode invocation of the same data layer emits schema-versioned frames incl. `control_request{decision_id}` (P1.5); NO_COLOR renders the four-glyph ASCII fallbacks |
| G8 | Brand tokens | Palette table from brand-brief §2 loaded from one Go/Rust constants file; truecolor + 256 fallback verified in Terminal.app and a 256-color tmux |

### 4.2 Go spike specifics

- Stack: `charm.land/bubbletea/v2`, lipgloss, bubbles v2 (textarea, viewport, spinner); diff via chroma + a minimal unified renderer (crib Crush's approach).
- Extra gate **G9-go**: per-entry rendered-string cache demonstrates O(changed rows) — instrument `View()` cost with and without cache at 2k entries.
- Extra gate **G10-go**: emit cursor-position so G4 passes; if #874's failure mode appears, attempt the workaround (position hardware cursor via v2 cursor API at the caret each frame) and record whether it requires upstream patching.

### 4.3 Rust spike specifics

- Stack: ratatui 0.30, crossterm, ratatui-textarea, ansi-to-tui (feed it `git diff --color` output directly); NDJSON JSON-RPC client over `std::os::unix::net` (~300 LoC, serde_json).
- Extra gate **G9-rs**: count plumbing LoC honestly (client + hand-written types for the ~10 methods used) — this number feeds the final decision if triggers fire.
- Extra gate **G10-rs**: `Frame::set_cursor_position` anchored at the textarea caret passes G4 on both platforms.

**Decision rule:** if both pass all gates → Go wins on §2.3's gating rows. If Go fails G4 or G6 and Rust passes → reversal trigger 1/2, ratatui wins and a P3.1 amendment is drafted. If both fail G4 → the failure is terminal-side; pick Go and ship R21 mitigations, tracking upstream.

---

## 5. Production implementation

### 5.1 Shipped structure

The production shape stayed deliberately flatter than the proposed spike
layout:

```text
apps/carina-tui/main.go      launcher, flags, config, keymap watch, connection
go/tui/                      root model, transcript, composer, overlays, PTY tests
go/tui/theme/                terminal capability detection and semantic tokens
go/config/                   layered TUI configuration and atomic keymap writes
go/rpc/                      typed call and event-stream transport shared with CLI
```

Keeping interaction components in one `go/tui` package made modal input
ownership, submission transactions, and cursor arbitration explicit without
introducing a second UI-domain layer. The launcher remains thin, while the
daemon and RPC contracts remain authoritative for approvals, checkpoints,
history, and task state.

### 5.2 Interaction contracts adopted

The final interaction design incorporates the transferable lessons from the
Claude Code internals notes and the current Codex TUI without copying either
framework architecture:

| Contract | Production resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Input ownership | Governance overlays own all input. During submission acknowledgement, the submitted snapshot remains frozen and type-ahead creates an independent next draft; asynchronous ACK/failure cannot overwrite it |
| Fast control path | `Esc` interrupts an active turn; `Ctrl+C` retains the cancel/clear/exit cascade; help and redraw remain available while acknowledgement is pending |
| Non-linear conversation | Double `Esc` from an idle empty composer opens checkpoints; selection fetches a rollback preview and restore requires explicit `y` plus `Enter` confirmation |
| Semantic keys | Chat, composer, editor, suggestion, approval, question, history, and pager actions are semantic bindings. Validation derives conflicts from contexts that can actually be active together, keeps printable pager controls overlay-only, protects composer text and editor Home/End, folds terminal-equivalent keys, and rejects ambiguous chord prefixes; the pre-dispatch chord state machine provides a visible pending state, timeout, Esc cancellation, and unmatched-key replay |
| Keymap DX | `/keymap` browses and captures replacements/alternates, uses `Ctrl+V` quoted-insert for literal Escape/Enter steps, atomically persists project config, and applies a validated snapshot. Common modifier aliases are normalized; duplicate JSON actions fail with their object path instead of silently using the last value; managed/global/project edits hot-reload and invalid edits keep the last-good keymap |
| Recall scope | Durable prompt history carries session/workspace metadata. The TUI asks for workspace scope so unrelated repositories do not leak into default recall/search |
| Terminal mechanics | The view declares the physical cursor, enables bracketed paste and mouse wheel delivery, routes scrolling to the focused surface, and recomputes dimensions on resize |
| Background attention | Terminal focus reporting gates an unread-attention latch. Approval, question, and terminal task events emit BEL plus OSC 9/777 once per blur interval; refocusing clears the latch and status count |
| Regression evidence | Model tests cover ownership and overlay races; the PTY harness covers real resize/paste/wheel/multiline input/CJK terminal bytes where available; a production `View()` benchmark provides a stable render-regression target |

### 5.3 Scrollback decision

The strict Ink-style commit-once design considered during the spike was not
implemented and is not counted as a hidden pass. Carina instead exposes three
explicit modes:

1. The default alternate-screen viewport for a stable interactive layout.
2. `carina-tui --no-alt-screen` or `tui_alternate_screen=never` for the normal
   terminal buffer and native history.
3. `Alt+R` or `/transcript` for a plain, inspectable transcript pager.

This closes the product need without coupling transcript storage to terminal
painting. A commit-once static/dynamic renderer is a deliberate non-goal until
measured user evidence demonstrates that all three supported modes are
insufficient.

### 5.4 Evidence boundary and distribution

Repository automation can verify CJK cell width, grapheme edits, cursor
coordinates, bracketed paste, PTY resize, mouse reports, key dispatch,
checkpoint confirmation, and render regressions. It cannot honestly verify a
desktop IME candidate window, modifier-assisted text selection in every
terminal, or a credentialed provider stream on representative hardware. Those
remain release-matrix work in `docs/roadmap.md`, not source-code TODOs.

The Makefile builds `bin/carina-tui`, release packaging stages it with the
other binaries, and the Homebrew/npm launch paths require no Node.js runtime
for the TUI itself.

## Appendix: what would change this decision

- A mature, multi-maintainer React-model Rust framework with proven CJK input (none existed as of mid-2026 — the survey's explicit finding).
- Carina growing a Rust-side surface anyway (e.g., the CLI renderer migrating for other reasons) — re-run §3.4's everything-Rust option.
- Charm's v2 stalling (watch: release cadence, #874) — ratatui remains the standing runner-up with its spike results on file.

## Spike verdict (as run)

**Date:** 2026-07-09. Both §4 spikes ran the same day against the **real** daemon + Rust kernel + Zig tools (no mocks), and every automatable gate was then **independently re-verified by a second agent** (fresh builds, fresh tmux PTYs, fresh daemon spawns, own instrumentation reads) before this verdict was recorded. Independent-verification numbers below are the re-run values; spike-reported values are in the spike READMEs.

### Gate table — Bubble Tea v2 (Go), `spikes/tui-bubbletea/`

Stack actually used: `charm.land/bubbletea/v2` **v2.0.8**, bubbles v2.1.1, lipgloss v2.0.5; reused `go/rpc.Client` + `go/kernel` structs with ~0 plumbing LoC, as §2.2 predicted.

| Gate | Verdict | Evidence (spike run → independent re-run) |
|---|---|---|
| G1 live-daemon | **PASS** | Two-socket attach + `session.events.stream`; 12 external `command.exec` → 36 live events → re-run: fresh daemon, 5 external calls → 15 events (incl. zh output) streamed into the viewport live. |
| G2 approval | **PASS**¹ | Real `workspace.patch.propose` → pending patch → overlay with real colored unified diff (ANSI 38;5;42 adds / 38;5;203 dels confirmed in both runs) → `y` → applied, file on disk. decision_id path re-run end-to-end: `/cmd mv …` → `requires_approval` + `decision_id perm_18c08fbe…` → `task.action.approve` → command executed (`renamed.txt` on disk), resume events streamed. |
| G3 cjk | **PASS** (automated) / **PENDING-HUMAN** (IME) | Re-run: required zh lines rendered; `carina 审批测试 with mixed 中英 text` typed through tmux PTY; 7 backspaces deleted grapheme-per-keypress; bracketed paste collapsed to `[Pasted 11 lines]`; **all 31 bordered rows exactly 108 display columns** (east-asian-width check) — zero tearing. |
| G4 perf | **PASS** | Re-run, 100 ev/s × 10 s (1000 events): **frame render p95 9.38 ms** (spike: 10.98) vs 16 ms gate; event→flush p95 16.5 ms vs 33 ms criterion; **idle CPU 0.00 % mean / 0.0 % max** over 30×1 s ps samples (spike: 0.60 %) vs 1 % gate. |

¹ The spike itself did not drive a credentialed model through
`awaitInteractiveApproval`. The production repository now covers durable and
live `permission.request` projection, `decision_id` round trips, reconnect
replay, approve/deny behavior, and patch-gate enforcement. A real-provider run
remains part of the external release matrix.

### Gate table — ratatui 0.30.2 (Rust), `crates/spike-tui-ratatui/` + `spikes/tui-ratatui/`

| Gate | Verdict | Evidence (spike run → independent re-run) |
|---|---|---|
| G1 live-daemon | **PASS** | Re-run via `run-gates.sh` end-to-end green: fresh isolated daemon+kernel, two connections, real events rendered in follow-scrolling transcript; all captures alignment-checked (100/100 cols). |
| G2 approval | **PASS**¹ | Re-run live: real PatchTransaction diff as colored prompt body (28 ANSI-escape lines in capture) → applied; real `pendingCmds` approval `perm_18c08e8e…` → `task.action.approve` → `decision:"allowed"`, command executed; deny path exercised (`task.action.deny`). |
| G3 cjk | **PASS** (automated) / **PENDING-HUMAN** (IME) | Re-run: required zh lines rendered; `中英 text` → 5 backspaces removed ` text`, next removed whole `英`; **hardware cursor pinned to caret** (`Frame::set_cursor_position`): after `你好 world` cursor x=11, arrowing over `好`/`你` jumps exactly 2 columns — R13 architecture demonstrably works; all bordered rows exactly 100 display columns. |
| G4 perf | **PASS** | Re-runs: **frame render p95 5.3–7.3 ms** (spike: 3.8–8.3) vs 16 ms gate; **idle CPU 0.00 % mean / 0.0 % max** over 30×1 s samples vs 1 % gate. |

G9-rs (plumbing honesty): first Rust JSON-RPC client = 106 code LoC, but **zero typed wire models written** (stringly `serde_json::Value` throughout); the §2.2 estimate of ~500–1000 LoC hand-written structs + permanent drift stands for production.

### Verdict

**Bubble Tea v2 (Go) is confirmed as the TUI stack.** Per §4's decision rule: both spikes passed all automatable gates, so Go wins on §2.3's gating rows (C2 shared data layer, team-stack coherence, ≈0 plumbing — all empirically confirmed: the Go spike needed no new plumbing code while the Rust spike hand-wrote a client and still dodged the typed layer). **No reversal trigger fired**: the zh gates passed automated verification on both sides (trigger 1 requires a Go IME failure *and* a Rust pass — both IME runs are still PENDING-HUMAN, below); perf gates passed with wide margin on both sides (trigger 2 requires a Go failure); Charm's v2 cadence is active at v2.0.8 (trigger 3). ratatui remains the standing runner-up **with passing spike results now on file** — if the human fcitx5 run fails on Bubble Tea and passes on ratatui, trigger 1 fires and §3.2 applies.

### External human-verification items

Both spikes' IME composition tests are **PENDING-HUMAN** (true IME composition cannot be automated; binaries are built). Run the checklists in `spikes/tui-bubbletea/README.md` ("Manual IME checklist") and `spikes/tui-ratatui/README.md` ("5-minute manual IME checklist") on macOS Pinyin first, then fcitx5/Wayland (the decisive platform for bubbletea#874), recording pass/fail per platform in those files. The Bubble Tea run gates trigger-1; the ratatui run is the comparison arm.

These checks are release evidence, not missing repository implementation. They
must also record normal-buffer/alternate-screen behavior and terminal text
selection while mouse reporting is enabled.

### Production consequences (resolved after the spikes)

**Adopt / keep:**

- Bubble Tea v2, bubbles v2, and lipgloss v2 remain the production stack; the
  typed Go RPC/event path is shared with the CLI.
- CJK width/grapheme handling stays in the upstream terminal libraries, while
  Carina owns physical cursor placement, modal cursor arbitration, paste
  normalization, and narrow-layout clamping.
- Approval bodies use the daemon's reviewable artifacts and preserve the exact
  `decision_id`; patch apply verifies the prior capability decision.
- The production transcript has cached presentations, collapse/expand, a raw
  pager, focused wheel routing, and a repeatable `View()` benchmark.
- Submission acknowledgement, queue ownership, and overlay input are modeled
  as explicit transactions rather than timing assumptions.

**Retained framework cautions:**

- `tea.WithOutput` silently disables rendering unless the writer implements `term.File` (`Fd/Read/Close`) — R22 instrumentation wrappers must forward `Fd`.
- Component widths must remain clamped before the first `WindowSizeMsg`, and
  paste content must continue normalizing carriage returns before line counts.
- Overlay composition intentionally uses one modal owner and explicit cursor
  suppression; adopting the v2 Layers API would require new ownership tests,
  not just a visual refactor.
- Track bubbletea#874 until the fcitx5 human run is recorded; keep the ratatui
  spike and evidence as the comparison arm.
